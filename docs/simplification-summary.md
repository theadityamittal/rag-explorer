```

### **Dependencies Reduced:**
```toml
# From 20+ complex dependencies to 10 core ones:
dependencies = [
    "click>=8.1.0",              # CLI interface
    "rich>=13.0.0",              # Pretty output
    "chromadb==0.5.5",           # Vector database
    "python-dotenv==1.0.1",      # Environment variables
    "beautifulsoup4>=4.12.3",    # HTML parsing
    "lxml>=5.2.2",               # XML parsing
    "openai>=1.0.0",             # OpenAI API
    "anthropic>=0.25.0",         # Claude API
    "google-generativeai>=0.3.0", # Gemini API
    "ollama>=0.3.0",             # Local Ollama
]
```

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theadityamittal/rag-explorer.git
cd rag-explorer
pip install -e .
```

### **Basic Usage:**
```bash
# Set up Ollama (local, free)
ollama pull llama3.1
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# Index documents
rag-explorer index ./docs

# Ask questions
rag-explorer ask "How do I configure authentication?"

# Check status
rag-explorer status
```

### **With API Providers:**
```bash
# Set up API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER="openai"

# Use as normal
rag-explorer ask "Explain the deployment process"
```
